# EficcientNet:

### For the project of EfficientNet, the task was to use any model of machine learning, in this case I used EfficientNet, to learn and classify some images with or without tumor, than the model need to classify the images. 
### I used data augmentation to increase my dataset and improve the accuracy, and also use ajustable hiperparameters to have better results.
