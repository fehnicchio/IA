# Repository for Machine Learning's projects

## EficcientNet:

### For the project of EfficientNet, the task was to use any kind of maching learning, in this case I used EfficientNet, to learn and classify some images with or with tumor, than the model need to give the answer if the image has tumor or not. 
### I used data augmentation to increase my dataset and improve the accuracy, and also use ajustable hiperparameters
