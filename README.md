# Repository for Machine Learning's projects
## I'm using CNN(EfficientNet) and LLM(ChatBot)

## EficcientNet:

### For the project of EfficientNet, the task was to use any model of machine learning, in this case I used EfficientNet, to learn and classify some images with or without tumor, than the model need to classify the images. 
### I used data augmentation to increase my dataset and improve the accuracy, and also use ajustable hiperparameters to have better results.

## ChatBot:

### For this project, I used the Gemini's API to create a Chatbot. This code was created with Imers√£o IA with Alura and Google
### To use, you need to put your API Key(created in Google AI Studio), copy than paste in "YOUR_API_Key".
### I put to block none of safety settings, just to test the chatbot. Maybe has some hate, sexual and harassment context on the answer of chatbot.
